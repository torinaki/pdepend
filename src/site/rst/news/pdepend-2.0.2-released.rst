We are proud to announce version `2.0.2`__ of PDepend. For more
details visit the version release `site`__.

With this release we make `composer`__ a first citizen distribution channel of
PHP_Depend, just add PHP_Depend as a dependency to your ``composer.json`` ::

  {
      "require": {

          "pdepend/pdepend" : "2.0.2"
      }
  }

Then install Composer in your project (or `download the composer.phar`__
directly):

.. class:: shell

::

  ~ $ curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php

And finally let Composer install the project dependencies:

.. class:: shell

::

  ~ $ php composer.phar install
